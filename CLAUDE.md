# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working
with code in this repository.

## What this is

`zuid` is a complete UUID implementation for R with two rings around it.
The core is RFC 9562 in full: versions 1 to 8, nil and max, name-based
and monotonic generation, every RFC text form. The first ring re-encodes
the same bytes (Crockford base32, base36, base58, base62, base64url,
Base62sort and Base64sort, any alphabet, Proquint, Niceware words). The
second ring is the kindred formats: ULID, TypeID, UPID, SCRU128, SCRU64,
KSUID, Snowflake and Sonyflake, XID, ObjectId, NanoID, Cuid2, Sqids and
CID. One `id_` vocabulary detects, parses, validates, reads fields and
time, converts and generates across all of them. No `Imports` and no
vendored code. v0.1.0 has no interface with other `zu*` packages: Arrow
interchange (`zuarrow`), integers (`zuint`), name-based UUIDs and CID
generation (`zucrypt`) and exact instants (`zutempo`) come after it, as
`Suggests`. It is not a hashing package, not a random number generator,
not a database driver, and in v0.1.0 not a password generator.

The specification is
[`.agents/design.md`](https://pedrobtz.github.io/zuid/.agents/design.md),
adopted from [RFC
0043](https://github.com/pedrobtz/packages/blob/main/rfcs/started/0043-zuid-identifiers-beyond-uuid.md).
It outranks this file: `CLAUDE.md` orients, the design doc decides.

## Current state

Scaffolded 2026-10-24 with `create-pkg.sh`; no functionality yet. The
roadmap in `.agents/roadmap.md` takes it to v0.1.0.

## Stage tracking

Progress toward the next version is tracked as GitHub sub-issues, so the
parent issue shows a progress bar such as “6 of 7”.

- **One parent issue per target version**, titled with the bare version,
  for example `v0.1.0`. `v0.1.0` issue: created by `pkg-roadmap`.
- **One sub-issue per roadmap stage**, titled as the roadmap titles it,
  for example `Stage 3 — R interface`, and linking to that section. The
  number of stages is whatever the roadmap has; there is no fixed scale.
- **Every tracking issue carries the `stage` label**, so it can be told
  apart from bug and feature issues and left out of open-issue counts.
- **Close a stage by merging its pull request.** Put `Closes #<n>` in
  the body of the stage’s pull request. Never close a stage whose exit
  criteria are not met; record a deviation in the roadmap first.
- **The roadmap stays authoritative.** The issues record which stages
  are done, not what a stage requires. Adding, removing or renaming a
  stage means editing the roadmap and the sub-issues in the same change.
- **Each stage has a CI tier, `quick` or `full`.** The roadmap sets it,
  and `quick` is the default. See Continuous integration for what each
  means. The second-to-last stage, `Full CI`, runs the full set and
  fixes what it finds before `v0.1.0 readiness`.
- Close the parent issue when CRAN accepts the version and it is tagged.
  Opening a parent issue implies at least one stage sub-issue; a parent
  with no sub-issues shows no progress on the board.

## Versioning

A new package develops at `0.0.0.9000` and targets `0.1.0` for its first
CRAN release. Set `Version: 0.1.0` and the matching `NEWS.md` heading
when the package enters `Pre-flight`. Bump to `0.1.0.9000` only after
CRAN accepts it, never before: a `.9000` version above an unreleased
`0.1.0` heading is wrong.

Until the first release the R API may change freely. Sibling packages
can Until the first release the R API may change freely. Sibling
packages can still depend on this one before CRAN does, through
`Remotes:` or `LinkingTo:`. The design names consumers that will call
the R functions (`zucbor`, `zumsgpack`, `qio`, `zujson`, `mdbx`,
`dastash`, `zudedup`, `openlineage`); a C API for them is a later
version, not v0.1.0. A package that others wait on should reach CRAN
first.

## Commands

Run from the package root.

``` sh
Rscript -e 'devtools::load_all()'                # compile src/ and load
Rscript -e 'devtools::document()'                # roxygen -> NAMESPACE, man/
Rscript -e 'devtools::test()'                    # full testthat suite
Rscript -e 'devtools::test(filter = "<name>")'   # one test file
Rscript -e 'devtools::test(shuffle = TRUE)'      # order independence
Rscript -e 'devtools::check()'                   # R CMD check
air format .                                     # format R sources
```

## Architecture

To be written as stages land; see `.agents/design.md` §4 for the planned
five layers. The scaffold set up C through `usethis::use_c()`:
`src/zuid.c` is an empty stub and `R/zuid-package.R` carries the
`@useDynLib`.

## Invariants that are easy to break

These are fixed by the design before any code exists.

- **No `Imports`.** After 0.1.0 other `zu*` packages become `Suggests`,
  checked with
  [`requireNamespace()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/ns-load.html); a missing
  one raises `zuid_dependency_error`. In v0.1.0 no `zu*` package is
  referenced at all.
- **Entropy comes from the operating system, never R’s RNG** (D5). An
  identifier must not change when a script calls
  [`set.seed()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html). Tests that need
  fixed output pass `random` in.
- **Generators are pure functions of `(n, time, random, node)`** (D6).
  The clock and entropy are read once in the R entry point. Reading them
  inside a generator makes the fuzz target and the cross-platform
  byte-identity tests impossible.
- **128 bits do not make a UUID** (D3, D9).
  [`id_from_bytes()`](https://pedrobtz.github.io/zuid/reference/id_format.md)
  has no default format, and only `uuid` exports to Arrow as
  `arrow.uuid`; every other format uses `zuid.<format>`. A ULID arriving
  as `arrow.uuid` is the bug this prevents.
- **Detection never guesses** (D10). An encoding or syntactic format
  needs a hint; ambiguity among structured formats is `NA` with
  candidates.
- **Inspection never raises on input.** `id_detect()`,
  [`id_valid()`](https://pedrobtz.github.io/zuid/reference/id_parse.md),
  [`id_fields()`](https://pedrobtz.github.io/zuid/reference/id_fields.md),
  [`id_time()`](https://pedrobtz.github.io/zuid/reference/id_fields.md)
  and `id_parse(strict = FALSE)` return `NA`.
- **The only place a `CHARSXP` is made from bytes is one function** in
  `src/zuid_r.c`, and the shared object exports `R_init_zuid` only.
- **No vendored code** (D7). The Sqids blocklist and the Niceware word
  list are generated tables with source, date and SHA-256 in
  `tools/fixture-sources.yaml`.

## Testing conventions

- **Self-sufficient.** Every test builds its own inputs inside the
  `test_that()` block. No file-scope objects.
- **Self-contained.** Global state goes through `withr::local_*()`,
  randomised input through
  [`withr::local_seed()`](https://withr.r-lib.org/reference/with_seed.html).
  Tests write only under
  [`tempdir()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/tempfile.html).
- **Assert on condition classes, never message text.** Use
  `expect_error(..., class = "<pkg>_<kind>_error")`. Wording belongs in
  snapshot tests.
- **Order independence.** `devtools::test(shuffle = TRUE)` is part of
  the definition of done.
- **Borrow a conformance suite before writing one.** Mainstream
  implementations in Python, Java, Go or Node usually ship a test
  corpus. Use it as an oracle rather than inventing cases by hand. This
  package’s oracles are the thirteen of `.agents/design.md` §7 (RFC 9562
  Appendix A, TypeID’s `valid.yml` and `invalid.yml`, the ULID, SCRU,
  KSUID, XID, Sqids, Proquint, Niceware and CID reference vectors, and
  others), stored under `tests/testthat/fixtures/` at commits pinned in
  `tools/fixture-sources.yaml`. None exist yet.
- **Helpers live in `tests/testthat/helper-*.R`.** None yet.
- **Keep the suite inside the CRAN time budget.** No suite yet.

## Definition of done

`devtools::document()` and `devtools::check()` clean, meaning 0 errors,
0 warnings and 0 notes. The one allowed note is “New submission” before
the first release. `devtools::test(shuffle = TRUE)` green. CI green at
the change’s tier: the quick profile for a `quick` roadmap stage or an
ordinary pull request, the full profile for a `full` stage, `Full CI`,
and every release. A user-facing change also needs a test, roxygen
documentation and a `NEWS.md` entry.

## Releasing to CRAN

- **CI is the pre-submission check.** The `pedrobtz/r-actions` R CMD
  check runs `--as-cran` on the CRAN-like runners and containers, and it
  replaces win-builder, the macOS builder and R-hub. None of them is a
  release step, and `cran-comments.md` lists the CI legs as its test
  environments.
- **Entering `Pre-flight`.** The roadmap’s feature stages are done, the
  version is set as in Versioning, `NEWS.md` and `cran-comments.md` are
  written, and CI is green. Only submission work remains.
- **Before submitting,** run `pkg-critical-review` once the roadmap is
  implemented and fix what it files, then `pkg-cran-review`, and resolve
  every finding. Both skills are in `pedrobtz/r-skills`.
- **The pretest is automated and does not read `cran-comments.md`.** A
  NOTE that is explained but not fixed gets the upload archived. Fix the
  NOTE, as under Vendored native code, instead of justifying it.
- **After acceptance,** `pkg-post-cran` tags the submitted commit with
  the bare version, `0.1.0` (no `v`), publishes the GitHub release,
  bumps to `0.1.0.9000`, closes the version’s parent issue and moves the
  board card.

## Editing rules

- roxygen comments are the source. Never edit `man/` or `NAMESPACE` by
  hand.
- Edit `README.Rmd`, not the generated `README.md`.
- Keep prose simple and short. One idea per sentence.
- Wrap roxygen text at 80 characters and run `air format .` on R
  sources.
- Use `lower_snake_case`, and prefix internal native symbols with
  `<pkg>_`.
- Keep hard runtime dependencies at zero unless a recorded design
  decision says otherwise.
- Export and document public functions. Do not create roxygen topics for
  internal ones.

## Continuous integration

Workflows come from `pedrobtz/r-actions`. Call those reusable workflows
instead of writing bespoke ones, and pin a released tag rather than
`main`. Pin a workflow that holds a write token, such as `coverage.yml`,
to a commit, with the tag in a comment. The `R-CMD-check` workflow must
call `r-cmd-check.yml`, because a hand-rolled one does not count as the
pre-submission check. This package calls `r-cmd-check.yml` and
`coverage.yml`; the pkgdown site is built by a local `pkgdown.yaml`.

Small edits get a small run. The shared workflows look at the files a
pull request changes, compared with its merge base:

- **Markdown only**, such as `README.md`, `NEWS.md` or
  `cran-comments.md`, skips every check. Only coverage and the pkgdown
  site run.
- **`DESCRIPTION` or `README.Rmd` as well**, and nothing else, adds one
  R CMD check on Ubuntu R-release.
- **Any other file** runs everything.

So put a README or `DESCRIPTION` touch-up in its own pull request. Once
a pull request changes code, every later push to it runs every workflow.

### Quick by default, full by exception

The full profile is slow. gctorture at step 20 alone has taken 36 to 107
minutes on sibling packages. Waiting on it between roadmap stages was
the main thing slowing roadmaps down, so:

- **Pull requests run the quick profile.** It should finish in under
  five minutes. If it doesn’t, raise gctorture’s `quick-step` or trim
  `quick-containers` in the caller workflows; never cut the full
  profile.
- **A `full` roadmap stage takes the `full-ci` label** and merges only
  on a green full run. The roadmap gives the reason in the stage’s
  `**CI.**` line, for example first compiled code, a `PROTECT` or
  finalizer change, a vendored library, or a Windows-only path.
- **Don’t wait on the full run a merge starts** on the default branch,
  and cancel older full runs it supersedes. A failure that only the full
  set shows goes on the `Full CI` stage issue as a comment with the run
  link, and is fixed there. A failure the quick profile also shows is
  fixed now.
- **`Full CI` and `v0.1.0 readiness` wait** for a green full run on
  their merge commit, and the release commit always needs one.
- Locally, run `gctorture(TRUE)` on the code a C change touches when it
  is cheap; the full run is the authority.

## Commits and pull requests

Short, imperative, sentence-case commit subjects, optionally scoped.
Keep each commit focused and do not sweep in unrelated files. A pull
request explains the user-visible outcome and the rationale, links
related issues, lists the checks that were run and the tests that were
skipped, and flags platform-sensitive or vendored changes. Performance
claims need evidence.

Never commit or push to the default branch. Work on a branch, open a
pull request, and leave it for review. Do not merge a pull request
unless you are told to.

When you find a defect, in this package or in an upstream tool, open an
issue for it rather than only working around it.

## Working with skills

The portfolio’s workflow skills live in `pedrobtz/r-skills` (`pkg-init`,
`pkg-roadmap`, `pkg-implement`, `pkg-critical-review`,
`pkg-cran-review`, `pkg-post-cran`, `pkg-readme`); the general process
skills are [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers).
`building-a-package.md` in `pedrobtz/packages` walks through them in
order. Both sets defer to this file where they overlap, so the
settlements are recorded here.

- **One design.** The specification is `.agents/design.md`, adopted from
  the package’s RFC in `pedrobtz/packages/rfcs`. A package with an
  adopted design is past `brainstorming`; a design change goes through
  the RFC, not a new spec. Superpowers’ default
  `docs/superpowers/specs/` is not used.
- **Plans at two levels.** `.agents/roadmap.md` holds the stages, one
  mergeable pull request each, with exit criteria and a CI tier
  (`pkg-roadmap`). Inside a stage, `writing-plans` breaks the work into
  tasks of one test cycle each, saved as `.agents/plans/stage-<n>.md`.
  The roadmap stays authoritative; a plan is scratch and is not kept in
  sync.
- **Build and merge.** `pkg-implement` runs the stage loop: branch
  `stage-<n>-<slug>` from the stage issue, implement the plan with
  `test-driven-development`
  (`Rscript -e 'devtools::test(filter = "<name>")'` is the red/green
  command), open the pull request, merge on green at the stage’s CI
  tier. The confirmation the user gives at the start of that loop is the
  “told to merge” that Commits and pull requests requires, so the
  `finishing-a-development-branch` menu is not presented for stage pull
  requests. Any other pull request still waits for review.
- **Failures and claims.** A failing check or test goes through
  `systematic-debugging` before a fix. “Green”, “done” and “ready for
  CRAN” are claimed only after `verification-before-completion`: run the
  command, read the output.
- **Review.** `requesting-code-review` gates tasks inside a stage.
  `pkg-critical-review` reviews the whole package once the roadmap is
  implemented, with Posit’s reviewers, and files issues. CRAN’s reviewer
  email and GitHub review threads go through `receiving-code-review`.
- **Keep scratch out of the tarball.** `R CMD build` reads
  `.Rbuildignore`, not `.gitignore`. It must list `^\.agents$`,
  `^\.superpowers$` (the Superpowers task ledger), `^\.worktrees$` (if
  git worktrees are kept in the package directory; a sibling directory
  avoids the question), `^\.claude$`, `^CLAUDE\.md$`, `^AGENTS\.md$`,
  `^CRAN-SUBMISSION$` and `^cran-comments\.md$`. A stray top-level file
  is a NOTE, and the pretest archives on NOTEs.
